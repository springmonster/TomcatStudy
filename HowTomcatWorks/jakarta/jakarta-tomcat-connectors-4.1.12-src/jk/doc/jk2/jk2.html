<h2>Jk2 architecture<br>
 </h2>
   
<h3>Definitions</h3>
   
<ol>
    <li>Engine. This is a tomcat instance, running in a java process. Each
 engine must  have a unique ID, and can be reached by multiple protocols
over  multiple transports</li>
    <li>Worker. A worker is the object serving ( processing ) the request.
 It can either forward it to a servlet Engine, to another worker or generate
 content itself ( status ). The important worker is "ajp13" implementing
a  simple/fast RPC mechanism. </li>
    <li>Channel. A channel represents a transport protocol, connecting 2
sides  for RPC communication. The most common and standard is the tcp socket.
Other  important  channels are unix socket and jni, which are not yet fully
supported. </li>
    <li>Endpoint. An endpoint represents an established connection between
 the web server and the java engine. The connection is reused, and multiple
 endpoints can exist and be active at the same time for one server/engine
pair. </li>
    <li>Logger. The logger reports jk errors and debug statements. The goal
 is to use the native server logging whenever possible. At this moment there
 is a single logger, in future we may be able to associate loggers with individual
 webapps. </li>
    <li>Config. The config stores and manipulates parameters for each jk
object. </li>
    <li>Uri ( XXX is it a good name ? ). A uri stores a pattern that is used
 to match requests, and asociated properties. </li>
    <li>UriMapper. This implements the matching of requests against uri patterns. </li>
    <li>WorkerEnv. The central controller, it controls global properties
and  provides access to all other objects. </li>
   
</ol>
 Each component instance has a name, that is used for configuration and at 
runtime. Each component has a number of configurable properties. The following 
rules are used:<br>
 
<ol>
   <li>The name is composed from the type and a local part, separated with 
a ':' ( example:  channel.unixsocket:/tmp/jk.socket )</li>
   <li>The 'type' consist of '.' and ascii characters.  It is mapped to a 
JMX 'domain'. </li>
   <li>The local part consists of ascii characters  and .:/;  <br>
 Note that '=,' are not currently allowed - a future version may support
the jmx syntax by using quotes to separate the local part from the property
and value ( in .properties mode we must use '=' to separate the value from
type, local name and property name ).</li>
   <li>The property is a simple name, with no dots. </li>
   <li>A simple form of substitution is used in values, where $(property) 
will be replaced with a  previously defined setting. If the property has ':'
in it, it'll take the value from the object, if not it'll take the value from
a global map.<br>
   </li>
 
</ol>
   
<h3>Configuration architecture </h3>
   
<p>Jk2 is using a mechanism similar with JMX to manage all its configurable
 objects. Each component is controled by a "jk_bean" structure, containing
 pointers  to the setAttribute/getAttribute functions.</p>
   
<p>The jk_config object abstracts the persistent repository of config informations.
 Most  components/properties can be configured at runtime. A runtime change
 can be made either directly on the object, affecting the running instance
 only ( by directly calling the object method or setting the field ), or
via jk_config, making it persistent.   <br>
  </p>
   
<p>The config API can be accessed using AJP14 messages, using a simple worker 
( like the status worker ) or by any other mean.<br>
 </p>
 
<h3>Communication protocol</h3>
   
<p> Jk2 supports multiple communication protocols ( RPC-style ) and multiple
 transports. In addition, each communication protocol supports multiple "APIs",
 or sets of  functions that are supported.  <br>
  </p>
   
<p>The current protocol is called AJP13. It supports marshalling/unmarshalling
 of  strings and ints, with minimal overhead.   <br>
  </p>
   
<p>The current API is also called ajp13. It consist of 5 methods:<br>
  </p>
   
<ul>
    <li> (oneway) forwardRequest (2): the marshaled request is encoded as 
parameter. </li>
    <li> (oneway) sendBodyChunk (3): sends the output of a request </li>
    <li> (oneway) sendHeaders  (4): sends the marshaled headers </li>
    <li>(oneway) endResponse (5): marks the end of the response </li>
    <li> (req/resp) getBodyChunk (6): get the POST body.</li>
   
</ul>
   
<p> It is desirable to migrate to a standard protocol for encoding and RPC
 ( CDR, XDR, etc ), and to support additional protcols ( like WARP ). However
 the AJP13 protocol is stable and shouldn't change in future.  <br>
  </p>
   
<p>The ajp13 API is also stable and frozen. In future, what will be called
 'ajp14'  may provide additional functions.  ( using the same name for API
 and protocol is very confusing, but that's what we have. We should at least
 call them consistently "ajp13 protocol" and "ajp13 api"  )  <br>
  </p>
   
<h3>Low level components </h3>
   
<p>Jk2 uses a object oriented style, allowing multiple implementations for
 each  object. The model is based on the style used in JNI ( and a bit Corba
 C bindings). Each function takes as parameter a pointer to an execution
context  ( jk_env ), a pointer to its own object structure, and the normal
parameters.   <br>
  </p>
   
<p>Jk_env is not completed, but it'll support basic exception handling (
JNI style ), a local pool, etc.  <br>
  </p>
   
<p>In addition, each configurable component has as the first member a jk_bean
 pointer, pointing to the JMX-like dynamic configurator.  The jk_env stores
 a table with all the known 'types', and a constructor for each.<br>
  </p>
   
<p> Each object has a name, either specified explicitely or generated from
 it's type. The object name has the type as prefix.  Jk_env also stores a
table with all existing 'instances', by name. <br>
  </p>
   
<p>It is assumed that all 'top level' objects will be long-lived ( including
 endpoints ).  <br>
  </p>
   
<h3>Default configuration</h3>
   
<p>Jk2 uses a config file ( jk2.conf ) in the style of a .properties or ini
 file. It can be configured to use any other backend that provides similar
 capabilities.<br>
  </p>
   
<p>  The default config file is user editable, but mod_jk will persist the 
changes requested by protocol. If you manually change the file while jk is 
working, your changes will be lost.   The config file supports no comments 
at this moment. We'll allow a limited  form of comments that can be persisted. 
  <br>
  </p>
   
<p>The default configuration format . .  Each setting consists of an object 
name and a property, with the associated value. The property name is a simple
 string, with no '.' in it. The name can be anything, but it must have a
known  'type' as prefix.  <br>
  </p>
   
<p>2 formats are supported:   <br>
  </p>
   
<pre>TYPE:NAME.PROPERTY=VALUE <br>and<br>[TYPE:NAME]<br>PROPERTY=VALUE<br><br></pre>
   
<p>In addition to the configuration file, properties can be set from the
main server config file - but those will not be modifiable.   <br>
  </p>
   
<p>Properties with no type prefix will be stored as 'global' properties.
<br>
  </p>
   
<p>The first time a name is found, the object will be created using the type
  prefix ( by looking for the longest match on all known types ).  <br>
  </p>
   
<h3>Default values / guessing</h3>
   
<p>Each component will do the best effort to detect it's environment and
set  default values, to minimze the user effort.  <br>
  </p>
   
<p>On startup, jk2 will set few global settings:     <br>
  </p>
   
<ul>
    <li>fs = file separator, / on unix, \ on windows</li>
    <li>ps = path separator, : on unix, ; on windows</li>
    <li>so = plaftorm extension for libraries ( .so, .dll, .nlm )</li>
    <li>(TODO) arch = system architecture</li>
    <li>(TODO) server.root = base directory for the server ( same as ServerRoot
 for apache )</li>
   
</ul>
   
<p>All those are either compile time or extracted from the running server,
 and  can be used to construct other settings.  A separate document defines
 all the supported properties and 'magic' that is used to automatically configure
 the object and simplify the config.<br>
  </p>
   
<h3>  Source code structure </h3>
   
<p>Each interface "foo" is defined in a file include/jk_foo.h. If the interface
 has a single ( or base ) implementation, it'll be called common/jk_foo.c.
 If it has multiple implementations, the files  will be named jk_foo_bar.c.
   All server-specific files are in server/[SERVER] ( server/apache2, etc
). The apache13 objects should be used as a basis for new servers, apache2
 has a number of extra fancy features to be used as model for 'deeper'  integration. 
  The default set of types is defined in common/jk_registry.c, common/jk_registry.h. 
 Additional types can be defined at runtime in the server adapter or various 
 other components.<br>
 <br>
 </p>
 
<h3>Limitations</h3>
 The current implementations has a number of limitations that will be removed 
in a future version:<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>You must specify the full object name. Future versions will allow
'shortcuts', i.e. use only the local part when it's not ambiguous.</li>
   <li>No '=' is allowed in the local part. A future version will use quotes 
to separate the local part, that will enable the =</li>
   <li>Since no = is allowed, the jk component name maps to a JMX name as 
'type: name=local_part'</li>
 
</ul>
 
<h3>Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All memory is now managed in pools. At runtime, the endpoint temporary
pool is used and recycled. However, during configuration and init we don't
use any temporary pool - and many of the temp. allocations happen in long-lived
pools. This is not a big waste ( it happen only at config ) and it's 'safer'
for now - but a temp pool will help. </li>
  <li>Speaking of memory, each object should be created consistently in its
own pool, and not in the parent pool. The API is right, but the code is still
messy. This will be important when we start removing/creating workers/uris
at runtime, right now everything is created at startup and doesn't matter.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Each thread should use it's own jk_env first - either using perthread
data or by using an objCache. The jk_env should provide a temp pool and error
handling.</li>
  <li>As mentioned before, exceptions are not implemented. ( the model is
identical with jni, as soon as we have  one env/thread we can start using
it)</li>
  <li>A lot more config guessing  and magic should happen in init(), to minimise
the user pain. </li>
  <li>Need to pre-set server_home and resolve all relative paths ( in log,
config ) with it.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
