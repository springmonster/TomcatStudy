      Note for Microsoft Windows operating system users

    <p>
      <b>Nope, the WebApp module still doesn't run under Windows and currently 
      any Microsoft operating system is not supported.</b> Since the past 
      release, though, many improvements were made, and we had positive repors 
      that the WebApp module actually tries to work also in that environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The effort to bring WebApp under Microsoft Windows lacks of active 
      developers, people (<b>like you</b>) who have access to this set of 
      operating systems (from Windows 98 to XP), have access to their 
      development tools and can make the difference.
    </p>

    <p>
      Multi-threaded support has now been added since the multi threaded 
      environment is now available also under UNIX based operating systems via 
      Apache 2.0, therefore the only things left to do are a little bit of 
      porting (not much, since the WebApp module is based on the 
      <a href="http://apr.apache.org/">Apache Portable Runtime</a>
      library, which does most of the job for you) and a lot of testing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>You</b> will be more than welcome to join the effort.
